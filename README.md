# Hangman Project Guide

## Initial Setup

Begin by creating your own version of this project:

1. Navigate to the top right corner and click "Use this template" to fork the project.
2. In the creation interface:
   - Name your repository hangman-project-[your_name].
   - Ensure the repository visibility is set to Private.

## Project Implementation

Your task is to develop the core functionality of the Hangman game:

1. Locate the HangmanService class. You'll find several methods marked as TODO within it. These methods define the backbone of the game logic.
2. Carefully implement each TODO method, ensuring that you adhere to the provided specifications and coding standards.
3. After implementation, it's crucial to validate your code. Navigate to the test directory and locate the HangmanServiceTest class.
4. Run the test suite. Your goal is to pass all tests, which verify the correctness of your implementation.

## Important Notes:

- All tests must pass to complete the project.
- Do not alter the HangmanServiceTest class. It is designed to test the expected functionality of your implementation without any modifications.
- Pay close attention to the feedback from the test suite. It can guide your debugging process and help you understand any discrepancies in your implementation.

By following these instructions carefully, you will develop a robust implementation of the Hangman game. This project not only assesses your ability to follow guidelines and implement specifications but also tests your problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. Good luck!
